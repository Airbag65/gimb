# Gimb
```Gimb``` is a very scaled down clone of ```Vim```, written in ```Golang``` as a small project to learn and get comfortable with the language.
The name is a play on the three words that make up the projekt: ```Go```, ```Vim``` and ```dumb```.  

Gimb is still very much in development and can not really be used for anything yet.

### How to use Gimb
If you for some unexplainable reason would like to try and use Gimb, this following section tells you how to set it up  

**TBD in full**  

As of now, Gimb comes only with a Makefile that cleans up the go module, builds the project and moves the binary to the home folder, i.e. ```~/```. 
To use it system wide you'll need to make an alias in your ```.$(SHELL)rc``` file. Mine is as follows:
```Bash
    alias gimb="~/gimb_out"
```
